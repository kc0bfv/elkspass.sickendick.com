# Breaker Notes

* 1 - Light switch and alarm system near fireplace, so also the outlets next to the big living room windows
* 2 - Back porch lights, back porch fans, doorbell (I think)
* 7 - All bathrooms, downstairs sconces, TV wall left side plug, front porch plug
* 9 - Back porch (sun room side) flood lights (maybe other sun room stuff), back porch (sun room side) outdoor outlet
* 11 - Kitchen overhead lights, dining room lights
* 13 - Master bedroom plugs and fan
* 14 - Garage flood light and driveway light, laundry room light
* 16 - Guest room plugs
* 18 - Kitchen counter plugs
* 19 - Baby room plugs

# Other Notes

* Guest room closet switch controls the attic light, in combination with the hall light switch

# Issues

* Kitchen dimmer does nothing (maybe connected to old lights in there or a dining room chandelier?)
* Sun room dimmer does nothing (maybe the light above the porch pergola?)
